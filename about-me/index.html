    <p>Hello! I'm a 4th year Mechanical Engineering student at Ohio State who will be pursuing a Master's
        to research propulsion technology (Perhaps RDREs). I have a multidisciplinary background from my work in propulsion, automotive, and robotics projects.
        My varied experience has helped me understand that I want to pursue propulsion at a deeper level since I think the problems in this field are some of the hardest around (and I like a challenge!).
        
        I am active on BSLI Liquid Rocket Systems, which is OSU's 
        liquid rocket spaceshot team. Currently, I am designing the main injector for a (thrust? forgot lol) kN 
        ox-rich staged combustion engine. I am also working with a small team to design a 1000 lbf liquid engine testing stand with a low enough profile to fit in the trunk of an SUV. See my <a href="izzydoyle.space">resume and portfolio</a>
        for more details! 

        Outside of my engineering endeavors, I pursue art, rock climbing, and completing lengthy sci-fi novels.

    </p>
